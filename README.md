The film demonstrates hosted getmcpads with staged data. Its creative galleries and MCP Apps interface belong to the hosted product. This repository provides the standalone native API tools.

**28 read tools** · **25 write tools**, disabled by default.

Run locally with your own platform credentials and a client that supports stdio MCP, such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code or Cursor. Your requests go directly to the platform. For managed connections, including supported ChatGPT setups, use the hosted option.

- Update native campaign/ad-group validation, budget ownership and exact readback checks.
- Add the native collection-ad tool and preserve private report URL and redirect guards.
- Exclude hosted frozen-file video upload workflows.
- Require Node.js 22.12 or newer and check Node 22/24 in CI.

[Full changelog](CHANGELOG.md) · [Source synchronization details](SOURCE_SYNC.md) · [All releases](https://github.com/get-mcp-ads/pinterest-ads-mcp-server/releases)

### Upgrade notes

Requires **Node.js 22.12 or newer**. CI covers Node 22 and 24. Version 2.0.1 drops Node 18 and 20 support. Read the current tool schemas before reusing saved arguments. Writes remain optional and require explicit confirmation. Hosted creative integrations and MCP Apps UI are outside this release.

## Install this release

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **28 read tools** | Reporting, campaigns and ad groups, audiences, targeting, keywords, conversions, catalogs, business assets, billing, Pins and trends |
| **25 write tools** | Off by default. Campaign and ad group status and budgets, campaign creation. Each one **previews before it applies** |
| **7 resources** | Live catalogues the model can read: reporting columns, attribution windows, creative assets, catalog reporting, surface map, recipes |
| **Organic alongside paid** | Pin analytics and trends, not just the ad account |
| **Privacy by construction** | Lead records are not exposed at all, and member identifiers are redacted by default |

### Raw column names, on purpose

Pinterest names its reporting columns in its own way, and this server accepts those names
directly rather than inventing friendly aliases on top. A column that exists in the API works
here; one that does not fails immediately rather than being silently translated into
something else.

`pinterest://reporting-columns` lists what is available, and `pinterest_validate_report`
checks a request before it runs.

---

## Privacy, built into what the tools return

Two protections, and they work differently.

**Lead records are never exposed.** `pinterest_get_lead_assets` returns lead form and
subscription configuration, but never the lead export itself, because those rows carry
personal information submitted by end users. This is an exclusion, not a redaction: the data
does not leave Pinterest through this server at all.

**Business member identifiers are redacted by default.** Member IDs, email addresses and
usernames are replaced before they reach the model when you read members, asset members or
invites. `includePersonalIdentifiers: true` returns the raw values and defaults to `false`.
These are your colleagues' addresses, so the default is the safe one.

---

## Getting a token

You need a Pinterest access token with the **`ads:read`** scope.

1. Create an app in the [Pinterest developer portal](https://developers.pinterest.com/).
2. Note the **App ID** and **App secret**.
3. Run the OAuth flow while signed in to the account that can access your ad accounts.
   Request `ads:read`, and `ads:write` only if you plan to enable writes.
4. Keep the **access token**, and the **refresh token** if you want the server to renew it.

📖 [Pinterest API authentication](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/authentication/)

You can run with just `PINTEREST_ACCESS_TOKEN`, but it expires. Supplying
`PINTEREST_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `PINTEREST_APP_ID` and `PINTEREST_APP_SECRET` together lets the
server renew the token itself, which is what you want for daily use.

Run **`pinterest_health_check`** as your first call. It verifies the token and lists the ad
accounts you can reach, without printing the token.

---

## Setup

### Claude Desktop

`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS)
or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pinterest-ads": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@getmcpads/pinterest-ads-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PINTEREST_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Ask it: *"list my Pinterest ad accounts"*.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add pinterest-ads --env PINTEREST_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token -- npx -y @getmcpads/pinterest-ads-mcp-server
```

### Cursor

`.cursor/mcp.json` in your project, same shape as the Claude Desktop config above.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/get-mcp-ads/pinterest-ads-mcp-server.git
cd pinterest-ads-mcp-server
npm install && npm run build
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in your credentials
npm start
```

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PINTEREST_ACCESS_TOKEN` | none | Access token with `ads:read` |
| `PINTEREST_REFRESH_TOKEN` | none | With the two below, lets the server renew the token |
| `PINTEREST_APP_ID` | none | App ID, needed for refresh |
| `PINTEREST_APP_SECRET` | none | App secret, needed for refresh |
| `PINTEREST_AD_ACCOUNT_ID` | none | Optional default, saves passing it on every call |
| `PINTEREST_ENABLE_WRITES` | *unset* | Set to `1` to register the 25 write tools |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

Either the access token, or the refresh trio. The server refuses to start with neither.

```bash
npm run doctor
```

---

## Writes, and why they preview first

Write tools are **disabled by default**. Enable them with `PINTEREST_ENABLE_WRITES=1`, and
grant `ads:write` on top of `ads:read`.

When enabled, every write tool returns a preview and changes nothing:

```jsonc
// pinterest_update_adgroup_budget { adAccountId: "549…", adGroupId: "268…", dailyBudget: 50 }
{
  "applied": false,
  "action": "pinterest_update_adgroup_budget",
  "change": { "adAccount": "549…", "adGroup": "268…",
              "field": "budget_in_micro_currency", "amount": 50,
              "inMicroCurrency": 50000000 },
  "message": "Preview only, nothing was changed. Repeat the same call with confirm: true to apply this change to the live account."
}
```

Only a second call carrying `confirm: true` touches the live account.

This is deliberate. An assistant composes these calls, and it can pick the wrong ad account,
the wrong campaign, or the wrong order of magnitude on a budget. A mandatory preview makes
the mistake visible before it costs money, and gives a human the stopping point the protocol
does not guarantee on its own.

Two further guardrails:

- **`pinterest_create_campaign` always creates the campaign `PAUSED`.** There is no option to
  create it active.
- **Amounts are converted to micro units for you.** Pinterest holds money in millionths, so
  12.50 in the account currency is `12500000`. The preview shows both, so a
  factor-of-a-million mistake is visible before it applies. A daily and a lifetime budget
  sent together are refused rather than silently resolved.

| Tool | What it changes |
|---|---|
| `pinterest_update_campaign_status` / `pinterest_update_adgroup_status` | Pause, reactivate or archive |
| `pinterest_update_campaign_budget` / `pinterest_update_adgroup_budget` | Daily or lifetime budget |
| `pinterest_create_campaign` | Creates a campaign, always `PAUSED` |

## Security

- **The token is never logged**, at any log level, or written to disk.
- **One host is contacted, and only one**: `api.pinterest.com`. *A test fails the build if a
  second host appears in the source.*
- **No fetch follows a redirect.** Every outbound call sets `redirect: "error"`, so a redirect
  cannot forward your token to another host. *A test fails the build if any fetch omits this.*
- **Async report URLs are validated before being fetched.** Pinterest returns a download URL
  on a host it chooses; that value is data from the API, not something to trust. HTTPS only,
  no private or loopback address, no redirect, and no credential attached.
- **No telemetry.** The server makes no network call other than to Pinterest.

Full policy, including how personal data is handled: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
